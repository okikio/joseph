      description: "Boxer is a research platform design and built by myself and some other members of my research lab. The project started in late 2019 with some basic plans and really took off in 2020. The mobile robotic platform features several interesting designs that allow research on both its hardware and its software."

    | oxer is an autonomous robotic platform very similar to a conventional vehicle due to its ackerman steering design, and independent suspension. The project initially started as a platform to move material from one building to another but has since been repurposed as a test platform for new research performed at

    | At only 1.2 m x 0.8 m (46” x 30”), the platform can be both an indoor and outdoor vehicle. It boasts a sensor suite that will enable autonomy in the near future. These include, 6 cameras, four of which are assembled together with a 2D lidar in a craftly-named package called the lighthouse. There are also 8 ultrasonics, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a GPS module and many more. A 2.35kWh battery pack has also been designed internally to power the vehicle.

    | With its 4 independent wheels, it can comfortably hold as much as an average human being (75 kg).  Four independent wheels also allow for 3 different drive configurations, front wheel, rear wheel and all-wheel drive.

    | Due to space restrictions, hub motors were used and in doing so, a Five-link suspension design was implemented on both the front and rear wheels to ensure proper handling.
