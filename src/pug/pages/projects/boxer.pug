            |  oxer is an autonomous robotic platform very similar to a conventional vehicle due to its ackerman steering design, and independent suspension. The project initially started as a platform to move material from one building to another, but has since been repurposed as a test platform for all research performed at

            | At only 1.2 m x 0.8 m (46” x 30”), the platform can be both an indoor and outdoor vehicle. It boasts a sensor suite that will enable autonomy in the near future. These include, 4 cameras, one lidar, 8 ultrasonics and an inertial measurement unit (IMU).
