In high school I discovered a passion for engineering specifically the engineering of robots (which I later found out to be <strong>Mechatronics</strong>). So, I pursed this as a career choice in university, at Ontario Tech in Oshawa, Ontario (formally UOIT; it's near Toronto, Canada). I graduated with honors with a Bachlor of mechatronic engineering, and went straight into my masters. I am finishing up my masters this year and am available for any projects that requires inovative and creative thinking, as well as dedication. <br> <br> In case you are wondering, my skills outside engineering are problem-solving, leadership, communication and conflict resolution. <br> <br>")
