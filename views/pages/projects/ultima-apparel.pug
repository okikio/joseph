          span.layout-inline.layout-margin-dull project I took on with a few friends, to create an amazing line of clothing that ensured better health for the user, by giving them the information they need to make better decisions.As a mechatronics engineer I am adept at electrical, mechanical, and robotics, this allows me to take on a variety of projects, some more electrical, some robotic. I am often wonderstruck by mechatronics, and I like to create things that will leave others as wonderstruck as me when I see an amazing project.
